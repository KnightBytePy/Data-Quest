🎮 Model Monsters — An ML-Powered Battle Game
<p align="center"> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eSwGh3YK54JKU/giphy.gif" width="350"/> </p>

Model Monsters is a turn-based strategy game where each monster is powered by its own machine-learning model, and battles depend on real-time inference, probability modeling, and data-driven decision systems.

✨ Core Features

🤖 ML-Driven Creatures: Every monster is controlled by a lightweight ML model that adapts behavior using probability, feature weighting, and decision logic.

🧠 Strategic Battle Engine: Combat outcomes rely on model predictions, confidence scores, and data-driven action selection not random numbers.

🎨 Built in Unity: Smooth 2D visuals, polished UI flow, and extensible systems structured with maintainable C# architecture.

🔧 Modular Data Pipeline: Monsters, moves, and stats are all fed through a structured data layer for clean tuning, balancing, and future scaling.

📊 Explainable Mechanics: Battle logs expose model inputs/outputs to make gameplay transparent and analytically inspectable.

🛠️ Tech Stack
